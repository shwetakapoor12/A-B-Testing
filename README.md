# A-B-Testing
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.
We have done data analysis to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Major goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
